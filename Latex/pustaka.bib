Social network data is one of the most effective and accurate indicators of public sentiment. In this paper we have discussed a methodology which allows utilization and interpretation of twitter data to determine public opinions. Analysis was done on tweets about the iPhone 6. Feature specific popularities and male--female specific analysis has been included. Mixed opinions were found but general consistency with outside reviews and comments was observed.",

	abstract = {Web classification has been attempted through many different technologies. In this study we concentrate on the comparison of Neural Networks (NN), Na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers for the automatic analysis and classification of attribute data from training course web pages. We introduce an enhanced NB classifier and run the same data sample through the DT and NN classifiers to determine the success rate of our classifier in the training courses domain. This research shows that our enhanced NB classifier not only outperforms the traditional NB classifier, but also performs similarly as good, if not better, than some more popular, rival techniques. This paper also shows that, overall, our NB classifier is the best choice for the training courses domain, achieving an impressive F-Measure value of over 97\%, despite it being trained with fewer samples than any of the classification systems we have encountered.}
